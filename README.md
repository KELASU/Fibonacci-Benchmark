# Fibonacci-Benchmark
Fibonacci Benchmark Iterative and Recursive Homework
# How to run 🛠️
first enter wsl in your terminal 👉(If you're using VS Code)
```
wsl
```
else if you are already in your wsl you can go to the next step
👇
the next step is to enter the word/command "make" in your wsl
```
make
```
this will create the output files which will allow you to run the files
what file? 😕
well the main test file and the file needed for checking time complexity and space complexity.
how do we run it? ❓
by inputing the codes below into the wsl:
For time complexity of fibonacci iterative
```
./main_b_time_iterative.out
```
For time complexity of fibonacci recursive
```
./main_b_time_recursive.out
```
For space complexity of fibonacci iterative
```
./main_b_space_iterative.out
```
For space complexity of fibonacci iterative
```
./main_b_space_recursive.out
```
For main test
```
./main_test.out
```
